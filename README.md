# OpenSourceChallenge

# Hi there, I'm Aditee Srivatsava ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student on a mission to grow, and I'm currently participating in the **Festember Open Source Challenge** to kickstart my journey into the world of open source.

### What I'm Learning From This Challenge

This isn't just about making a single file; it's about building a core skill for any modern developer.

Through this challenge, I'm learning to:

* **Master Git & GitHub:** I'm getting hands-on experience with version control, which is essential for collaborative projects. Creating a repository, committing changes, and managing my profile are the first steps.
* **Embrace Community:** Open source is all about community. This challenge is teaching me how to engage with other developers, showcase my work, and prepare for future contributions.
* **Build a Developer Portfolio:** My GitHub profile is more than just a pageâ€”it's a live portfolio. This custom README allows me to tell my story, highlight my skills, and document my progress publicly.
* **Document My Work:** I'm learning the importance of clear documentation by creating this README. A well-written README helps others understand a project (or in this case, my journey!).

### My Journey: Festember Open Source Challenge

This is just the beginning of my 21-day commitment. I'm excited to apply these skills and grow as a developer, with a goal of contributing to larger projects and communities like Google Summer of Code in the future.

The journey starts here.
